## Background
Turns out Twitter didn't actually delete the 2014 layout like they said they did. If you use an alternate useragent it works again!

## Installation
Firefox will warn you about an unsigned addon. I promise this addon does none of the things they warn you about. :p

- Log out of twitter. (Sorry, it doesn't work while logged in)
- Download it!
- Open your downloads folder
- Drag the xpi file into the Firefox window.
- Accept everything it prompts you to
- Profit.

**Do not use this extension while logged in! It won't work and will constantly bug you about an "unsupported browser".**

## Issues
### The image viewer doesn't work! It just opens a coloured box. D:
I have no idea how to fix this. If you do, please fork this and fix it.

*Thanks to R3n for fixing an issue where Firefox would detect the Addon as Corrupted, Full Credit to Zusor for creating the original addon.*
